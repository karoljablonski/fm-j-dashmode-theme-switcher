## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

My first time creating page having two sides: light and dark. I feel like having better flow using flexbox and grid than before. Also CSS classes were created with BEM, that was my 2nd time and it's VERY helpful. BEM actually simplyfies coding when you think a little and use it correctly. JavaScript is ugly, just made light-dark switcher working.

### Continued development

Need to practise BEM, and JS, a lot of JS.
